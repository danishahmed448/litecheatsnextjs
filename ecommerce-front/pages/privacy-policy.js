                    This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information
                    is collected, used, and shared when you visit, submit

                  <p>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>
                  <p>
                    When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain
                    information about your device, including information about
                    your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the
                    cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as
                    you browse the Site, we collect information about the
                    individual web pages or products that you view, what
                    websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and
                    information about how you interact with the Site. We refer
                    to this automatically-collected information as “Device
                    Information.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We collect Device Information using the following
                    technologies:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    – “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or
                    computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier.
                    For more information about cookies, and how to disable
                    cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
                    <br />– “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and
                    collect data including your IP address, browser type,
                    Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and
                    date/time stamps.
                    <br />– “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic
                    files used to record information about how you browse the
                    Site.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally when you submit information, request a quote,
                    make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the
                    Site, we collect certain information from you, including
                    your name, address, payment information (including credit
                    card numbers), email address, and phone number. We refer to
                    this information as “Order Information.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy
                    Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and
                    Order Information.
                  </p>
                  <p>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>
                  <p>
                    We use the Order Information that we collect generally to
                    fulfill any requests placed through the Site (including
                    arranging your reservation, generating your quote,
                    processing payment information, arranging for shipping, and
                    providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations).
                    Additionally, we use this Order Information to:
                    <br />
                    Communicate with you;
                    <br />
                    Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and
                    <br />
                    When in line with the preferences you have shared with us,
                    provide you with information or advertising relating to our
                    products or services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We use the Device Information that we collect to help us
                    screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP
                    address), and more generally to improve and optimize our
                    Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our
                    customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess
                    the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns). We
                    also use Device Information and Order Information for
                    advertising purposes.
                  </p>
                  <p>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
                  <p>

                    customers use the Site–you can read more about how Google
                    uses your Personal Information here:
